# Express.js Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling. The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database. However, it lacks proper error handling for database errors and the case where a user is not found.  This can lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, demonstrating best practices for handling various error scenarios in an Express.js application.

## Bug

The primary issue lies in the absence of robust error handling.  The code doesn't gracefully handle scenarios such as database connection failures or cases where the requested user doesn't exist.  This can lead to cryptic error messages or application crashes.
